# Numpy
Numpy arrays are very fast and very powerful arrays.  Arrays can be differnt numbers of dimentions.  Numpy arrays can do anything that a normal python array could do. 
Can copy them by value or refrence easily. They can also be reshaped so that they will take on a new number of dimensions and length. Arrays can be combined and concatinated.
Arrays also can be spilt in what ever way is needed. Arrays can also be searched, sorted, or filtered.
